# Linear congruential generator
Linear congruential generator

In computers, there are specialized
mathematical functions (deterministic algorithms) for simulation of “random”
numbers. The numbers generated by these functions are called pseudo-random
numbers. This name comes from the fact that the random numbers are generated
based on mathematical formulas, which explode an initial “seed” (usually, a
number extracted from the computer clock) into a sequence of numbers that
follow a pattern. Thus, each new number in the sequence will be dependent on the
previous number provided by the same formula. An example of a pseudo-random
generator is the linear congruential generator:

where X1 is an integer seed, n indicates the total number of terms in the sequence,
m is the modulus, a is the multiplier, and c is the increment. The pattern of
such a function shows a characteristic distribution for long numerical sequences
that exceed the period (the cycle of repetition). The range of numbers of the
above function is between 0 and m −1, with a uniform distribution of integers.
The length of a period can be controlled by setting the value of m. However, a
narrow portion over this sequence shows a small piece of the wider pattern, thus
simulating randomness without showing the real distribution derived from the
initial seed (X1). The implementation from Additional algorithm 17.1 includes
those discussed so far on the linear congruential generator:

where x is the seed, a is the multiplier, m is the modulus, c is the increment, and r is
the variable that stores the number sequence. A new seed value (x=157) accompanied by changes in the values of variables a (the multiplier) and c (the increment)
can lead to much shorter and noticeable periods (Additional algorithm 17.2). For
example, the implementation below produces a period of four different numbers
(i.e. 22,2,12,7).
